A straightforward reproduction of the [Sierpinski Gasket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle) fractal. The fractal is a basic example of a self-similar set -- a mathematically generated pattern that repeats on every iteration, infinitely.

**Controls:**
* Press the 'Up' Key or Swipe Up to increase number of iterations
* Press the 'Down' Key or Swipe Down to decrease iterations
* Press the 'R' Key or Swipe Left to reset
