"Schotter" is a computer art work created by [George Nees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Nees) in the 1960s. Nees is considered a pioneer in generative computer graphics, and the piece examines the relationship between order and disorder with the use of random number generators. 

This piece is an animated variation upon the original. The effect of randomness upon the tiles ebbs and flows over time. In addition, the number of tiles grows and shrinks over time (and as this happens, the tile dimensions also change so that they all fit into the main rectangle). 

Many thanks to [Jim Plaxco](http://www.artsnova.com/artist-info.html) for [this tutorial](http://www.artsnova.com/Nees_Schotter_Tutorial.html), which also provides a wealth of additional information around Schotter.

Created with the [notan crate](https://crates.io/crates/notan) in the Rust programming language.
