Schotter is a piece of computer art created by George Nees in the 1960s. Nees is considered a pioneer in generative computer graphics, and the piece examines the relationship between order and disorder with the use of random number generators. 

Here are some variations on Schotter that I recently worked on as a way of exploring some Rust graphics crates. They start out with a basic reproduction and eventually proceed to an animated version.

Created with the notan crate (https://crates.io/crates/notan) in the Rust programming language.
