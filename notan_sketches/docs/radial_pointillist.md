Radial Pointillist is my first sustained attempt at [generative art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art). A simple system/algorithm involving parent nodes that radiate child nodes at a distance is repeated with enough varying aspects that each run can produce fairly distinctive outcomes (well, often enough, heh).

You can read a high level write-up of my process [here](radial_pointillist_overview.html)
