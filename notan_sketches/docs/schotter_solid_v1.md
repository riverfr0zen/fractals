"Schotter" is a computer art work created by [George Nees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Nees) in the 1960s. Nees is considered a pioneer in generative computer graphics, and the piece examines the relationship between order and disorder with the use of random number generators. 

This piece is a variation on the original that simply adds color fills. It was created with the [notan crate](https://crates.io/crates/notan) in the Rust programming language. 

Many thanks to [Jim Plaxco](http://www.artsnova.com/artist-info.html) for [this tutorial](http://www.artsnova.com/Nees_Schotter_Tutorial.html), which also provides a wealth of additional information around Schotter.
