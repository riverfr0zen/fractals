When my eyesight caught up, it showed in the distance a lush forest which drew me out further for its sparkling diffusion of the afternoon light; a cool sashaying of the branches and leaves with the open air. Towards some new serenity and friendship promised by this verdant shade did I advance, yet with every few steps I would still glance back, briefly, to the cave.\n",
